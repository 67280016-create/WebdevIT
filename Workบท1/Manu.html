    <h2>How to Make Spaghetti Sauce: Step-by-Step </h2>
    <ul>

        <li>2.Add tomatoes, water, and seasoning
            Now, add in crushed tomatoes and a little bit of water (about 1/2 cup). Season with kosher salt and black
            pepper to your liking. Stir in dry oregano, paprika and fresh herbs (basil and parsley).
            Bring this party to a boil briefly, then lower heat</li>
        <li>3.Simmer till nice and ready!
            Cover and let the sauce simmer for 15 to 20 minutes (I like to check on the sauce occasionally to give it a
            stir or add a tiny bit of my cooking pasta water if needed).
            You should end up with a gorgeous sauce that is the perfect thickness. Add a bit of fresh basil or parsley
            if you have some left.</li>

        <li>4.Add pasta & serve
            If you’re after the best tasting pasta, add your just cooked pasta to the sauce and cook for another 5
            minutes or so to allow the pasta to absorb the flavors and goodness of the sauce!</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Need meat? Spaghetti meat sauce option</h3>
    <p>A meatless pasta sauce is super versatile, that’s why I make it more often. But it’s easy to turn this into a
        hearty spaghetti meat sauce with very little effort.
        You’ll need about 1 lb of ground meat of your choices (ground beef, chicken, turkey, or Italian sauce).</p>
